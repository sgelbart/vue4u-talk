# What's up with Vue?

## Super simple to add to existing projects
The best thing about Vue is it can be easily used in just about any web app.

## No tooling or crazy changes?
You don't have to install any command line tools, know about node, complie anything, have any fancy tools, change your folder structure, anything.

## What do you need to know to get started?
If you know how to work with normal HTML and CSS, and have a basic understanding of JavaScript fundamentals, you are just about ready to go with Vue.

# Vue at its simplest...

1. Create html page
`https://jsfiddle.net/boilerplate/bootstrap`
2. Add vue
`<![CDATA[<script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@2.5.21/dist/vue.js"></script>]]>`
3. Add vue template
Normal template w/ID
Handlebar syntax
4. Load single variable
```
	var demo = new Vue({
	  el: '#myElement',
	  data: {
		message: 'Hello World'
	  }
	});
```

---

# Add sparkle

5. Add list of content
Make it cooler! Let's spice it up and cycle through some messages to liven up the page a bit...
```
data: {
	...
	messageOptions: [
		'Hola',
		'What\'s Up?',
		'What\'s Crackliackin\'?',
		'Hey hey hey!',
		'Yolo fools'
	]
	messageIndex: 0
},
methods: {
	cycleMessages: function () 	{
		var self = this;
		setTimeout(function(){
			self.message = self.messageOptions[self.messageIndex++];
			if (self.messageIndex > self.messageOptions.length){
			self.messageIndex = 0;
			}
			self.cycleMessages();
		},5000);
	}
}
```
And we want it to have it start changing right away when the component is created. (It could be called on click or something else instead...)

```
created: function(){
	this.cycleMessages();
}
```

---

# Easy Input Binding

5. Add variable binding
Add a custom field..

input with:

```
<![CDATA[<input v-model="message"/>]]>
```
Field is automatically set!
oops...it'll just get overridden...
```
@input="stopCycle"
```
(add to input)

Add function..
```
data: {
	...
	doCycle: true
},
methods:{
	//....
	stopCycle: function() {
		this.doCycle = false;
	},	
}
```
And inside our cycleMessage function...
```
if (doCycle) {
	self.cycleMessages();
}
```
